# Checklist.txt is ran when the checklist button is pressed
# It displays the checklist and crosses off the names of the patients you have already spoken to
#
# $GlobalVar is the empty game object that holds all of the global variables in the scene
# 'P1', 'P2', 'P3', etc. are booleans (true/false) that are true if you have spoken to a patient and false if not
# $testvalues are set by the booleans and checked to determine if the names in the checklist need to be struken through
# $CheckPat is the patient's name on the checklist
# $ChecklistButton is the button used to open and close the checklist
